Run the program as : python merge2.py output3.txt 
					 python merge2.py output3.txt 

The output of the Rung picture is saved inside otdir/Rungs/OutputPic.
Inside of Rungs change according to the text file.

Program dumps testMerge.jpg and zlast.jpg.


I will modify the program to stack Rungs at appropriate position. Output instruction bug is fixed.
